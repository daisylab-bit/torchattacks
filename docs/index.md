_A curated list of adversarial attacks in PyTorch, with a focus on transferable black-box attacks._

```shell
pip install torchattack
```

## Highlights

- 🛡️ A curated collection of adversarial attacks implemented in PyTorch.
- 🔍 Focuses on gradient-based transferable black-box attacks.
- 📦 Easily load pretrained models from torchvision or timm using `AttackModel`.
- 🔄 Simple interface to initialize attacks with `create_attack`.
- 🔧 Extensively typed for better code quality and safety.
- 📊 Tooling for fooling rate metrics and model evaluation in `eval`.
- 🔁 Numerous attacks reimplemented for readability and efficiency (TGR, VDC, etc.).
